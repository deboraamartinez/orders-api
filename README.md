# Service With Go

This project is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) service for managing orders. It's built using Go, Chi for routing, and Redis for data storage.

## Technologies Used

- **Go**: The main programming language used for developing the service.
- **Chi**: A lightweight, idiomatic and composable router for building Go HTTP services.
- **Redis**: An open-source, in-memory data structure store, used as a database and cache.
